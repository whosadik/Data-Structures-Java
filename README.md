# 📦 Data-Structures-Java

This repository contains a collection of core data structures and algorithms implemented in Java.  
Each folder includes a separate module or group of related tasks, from basic objects to advanced graph algorithms. All implementations are written from scratch without using Java's built-in data structures.
